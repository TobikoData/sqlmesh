## Our Pledge

To cultivate a welcoming and open environment for all our members, contributors and leaders, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience. This includes but is not limited to: age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Our shared community is a place to share ideas, have open discussions and help others, and it is not a place to solicit members.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards the other people in our community
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals but for the overall community
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism, which includes:
    - accepting responsibility,
    - apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
    - learning from the experience


Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, including the uninvited solicitation of goods and services
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, Slack posts, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces. Representing our community includes using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, representing the Tobiko or subsidiary brands (SQLMesh and SQLGlot) in any professional capacity such as acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Anyone in the community can report all abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at community@tobikodata.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders must respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
