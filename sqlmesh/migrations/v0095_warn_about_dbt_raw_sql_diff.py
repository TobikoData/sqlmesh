"""
Warns dbt users about potential diffs due to inclusion of {{ config(...) }} blocks in model SQL.

Prior to this fix, SQLMesh wasn't including the {{ config(...) }} block in the model's SQL payload
when processing dbt models. Now these config blocks are properly included in the raw SQL, which
may cause diffs to appear for existing dbt models even though the actual SQL logic hasn't changed.

This is a one-time diff that will appear after upgrading, and applying a plan will resolve it.
