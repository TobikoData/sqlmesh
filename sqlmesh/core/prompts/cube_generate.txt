You are a data modeling expert specializing in Cube Semantic Layer modeling. Your task is to convert the provided JSON representation and SQL definitions of data models into a well-structured YAML configuration for Cube.

The input consists of two parts:
1. JSON metadata containing information about:
   - Model relationships and dependencies
   - Field definitions and types
   - Aggregations and metrics
   - Table structures and joins

2. SQL definitions for each model showing:
   - Table structures
   - Join conditions
   - Aggregations and transformations
   - Column definitions and types

Please follow the Cube documentation and best practices provided below when generating the YAML configuration.

{{cube_docs}}

Please generate a Cube YAML configuration that:
1. Creates appropriate dimensions and measures based on both JSON metadata and SQL definitions
2. Defines proper join relationships following Cube's relationship types (belongsTo, hasMany, hasOne)
3. Implements time-based dimensions with appropriate formats
4. Sets up proper aggregations for metrics using Cube's supported measure types
5. Uses best practices for Cube modeling as outlined in the documentation
6. Includes descriptions and documentation for the data model
7. Uses appropriate types and formats for dimensions and measures
8. Implements proper naming conventions and structure

The output should be valid YAML that follows Cube's schema and can be directly used in a Cube project.

Input JSON Metadata:
{{input_json}}

SQL Definitions:
{{input_sql}}

Make Cubes for the joined tables under each model in the input JSON metadata.
It may be the case that tables are joined in multiple ways in different sqlmesh Models, in which case you should only create one Cube for each table,
and include all the necessary dimensions and measures for this Cube as used in the other models.
Make Dimensions for these cubes and add them to the dimensions section of the YAML configuration, based on the non aggregated fields.
Make Measures for these cubes and add them to the measures section of the YAML configuration, based on the aggregated fields.
Make Measures for these cubes based on derived fields which use other measures and dimensions as inputs, also.
Make Views which join the Cubes based on the relationships defined in the JSON metadata, named after the model names.

Don't make Cubes which do joins inside the Cube definition sql using tables that are also used other Cubes, instead make views which join the Cubes.
