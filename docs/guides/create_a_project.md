# Create a project

## Create a project from scratch

To get up and running with a new project that SQLMesh scaffolds for you, refer to the [quickstart guide](/quick_start).

* Make sure you have required dependencies.
* Create a folder
* Run `sqlmesh init`

## Edit an existing project

* There's nothing special to do for an existing project, you just use it as normal.

* CLI/Notebook you need to pass the path variable in pointing to your project.

## Import a DBT project

* Read the DBT guide
* All you need to do is run sqlmesh with a dbt flag (ask chris for this).
