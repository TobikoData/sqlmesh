# Evaluate a model

## Evaluate a model

You can evaluate a model using either the [CLI](/reference/cli) or [Notebook](/reference/notebook) with the `evaluate` command, which will run a query against a database or engine and return a dataframe. This method is used to test or iterate on models without side effects.

To evaluate a model:

1. Enter the `sqlmesh evaluate` command.
