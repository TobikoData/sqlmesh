# Multi-Repo guide

Although mono repos are convenient and easy to use, sometimes your organization may choose to use multiple repos. 
SQLMesh provides native support for multiple repos and makes it easy to maintain data consistency and correctness even with multiple repos.
If you are wanting to separate your systems/data and provide isolation, checkout the [isolated systems guide](https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/isolated_systems/?h=isolated). 

## Bootstrapping multiple projects
Setting up SQLMesh with multiple repos is quite simple. Copy the contents of this example [multi-repo project](https://github.com/TobikoData/sqlmesh/tree/main/examples/multi).

To bootstrap the project, you can point SQLMesh at both projects.

```
$ sqlmesh -p examples/multi/repo_1 -p examples/multi/repo_2/ plan

You can see that all 4 models were planned and applied even though bronze is in repo_1 and silver is in repo_2.

## Editing and planning one project

Make a non-breaking change to bronze.a by adding column c.

SQLMesh detects the entire lineage of the non-breaking change even though you only have one project "checked out".

SQLMesh correctly detects a breaking change and allows you to perform a multi-repo backfill.

## Configuring projects with multiple repositories

To add support for multiple repositories, add a `project` key to the config file in each of the respective repos. 

```yaml
project: repo_1

gateways:
...
```

Even if you do not have a need for multiple repos now, consider adding a `project` key so that you can easily support multiple repos in the future.

## Multi-Repo dbt projects

SQLMesh also supports multiple repos for dbt projects, allowing it to correctly detect changes and orchestrate backfills even when changes span multiple dbt projects. 

You can watch a [quick demo](https://www.loom.com/share/69c083428bb348da8911beb2cd4d30b2) of this setup or experiment with the [multi-repo dbt example](https://github.com/TobikoData/sqlmesh/tree/main/examples/multi_dbt) yourself.

## Multi-repo mixed projects

Native SQLMesh projects can be used alongside dbt projects in a multi-repo setup. 

This allows managing and sourcing tables from either project type within the same multi-repo project and facilitates a gradual migration from dbt to SQLMesh.

Use the same syntax as SQLMesh-only multi-repo projects to execute a multi-repo project with either dbt or a combination of dbt and SQLMesh projects:

```
$ sqlmesh -p examples/multi_hybrid/dbt_repo -p examples/multi_hybrid/sqlmesh_repo plan
```

SQLMesh will automatically detect dependencies and lineage across both SQLMesh and dbt projects, even when models are sourcing from different project types. 

Additionally, macros can be reused across both project types. For an example of this setup, refer to the [mixed SQLMesh and dbt example](https://github.com/TobikoData/sqlmesh/tree/main/examples/multi_hybrid).
