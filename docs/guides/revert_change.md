## Revert a change

---

Before reverting a change, ensure that you have already made a change, run `sqlmesh plan`, and applied your change.

---

To revert your change:

1. Open the model file you wish to edit in your preferred editor and undo the change you made earlier.
2. Run `sqlmesh plan` and apply your changes.
3. Observe that a logical update is made.

### Logical updates
Reverting to a previous version is a quick operation as no additional work is being done. For more information, refer to [plan application](/concepts/plans#plan-application) and [logical updates](/concepts/plans#logical-updates).
