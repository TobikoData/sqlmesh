# Plans

A plan is a set of changes that summarizes the difference between the local state of a project and the state of a target [environment](environments.md). In order for any model changes to take effect in a target environment, a plan needs to be created and applied.

During plan creation:

* The local state of the SQLMesh project is compared to the state of a target environment. The difference between the two and the actions needed to synchronize the environment with the local state are what constitutes a plan.
* Users may be prompted to [categorize changes](#change-categories) to existing models so SQLMesh can determine what actions to take for indirectly affected models (the downstream models that depend on the updated models). By default, SQLMesh attempts to categorize changes automatically, but this behavior can be changed through [configuration](../reference/configuration.md#auto_categorize_changes).
* Each plan requires a date range to which it will be applied. If not specified, the date range is derived automatically based on model definitions and the target environment.

The benefit of plans is that all changes can be reviewed and verified before they are applied to the data warehouse and any computations are performed. A typical plan contains a combination of the following:

* A list of added models
* A list of removed models
* A list of directly modified models and a text diff of changes that have been made
* A list of indirectly modified models
* Missing data intervals for affected models
* A date range that will be affected by the plan application

To create a new plan, run the following command:
```bash
sqlmesh plan [environment name]
```

If no environment name is specified, the plan is generated for the `prod` environment.

## Change categories
Categories only need to be provided for models that have been modified directly. The categorization of indirectly modified downstream models is inferred based on the types of changes to the directly modified models.

If more than one upstream dependency of an indirectly modified model has been modified and they have conflicting categories, the most conservative category (breaking) is assigned to this model.

### Breaking change
If a directly modified model change is categorized as breaking, it and its downstream dependencies will be backfilled.

In general, this is the safest option because it guarantees all downstream dependencies will reflect the change. However, it is a more expensive option because it involves additional data reprocessing, which has a runtime cost associated with it (refer to [backfilling](#backfilling)).

Choose this option when a change has been made to a model's logic that has a functional impact on its downstream dependencies. For example, adding or modifying a model's `WHERE` clause is a breaking change because downstream models contain rows that would now be filtered out.

### Non-breaking change
A directly-modified model that is classified as non-breaking will be backfilled, but its downstream dependencies will not.

This is a common choice in scenarios such as an addition of a new column, an action which doesn't affect downstream models, as new columns can't be used by downstream models without modifying them directly to select the column.

If any downstream models contain a `select *` from the model, SQLMesh attempts to infer breaking status on a best-effort basis. We recommend explicitly specifying a query's columns to avoid unnecessary recomputation.

### Forward-only change
A modified (either directly or indirectly) model that is categorized as forward-only will continue to use the existing physical table once the change is deployed to production (the `prod` environment). This means that no backfill will take place.

While iterating on forward-only changes in the development environment, the model's output will be stored in either a temporary table or a shallow clone of the production table if supported by the engine.

In either case the data produced this way in the development environment can only be used for preview and will **not** be reused once the change is deployed to production. See [Forward-only Plans](#forward-only-plans) for more details.

This category is assigned by SQLMesh automatically either when a user opts into using a [forward-only plan](#forward-only-plans) or when a model is explicitly configured to be forward-only.

### Summary

| [Forward-only](#forward-only-change) | [Direct](glossary.md#direct-modification) or [Indirect](glossary.md#indirect-modification) | [No Backfill](glossary.md#backfill), schema change |

## Plan application
Once a plan has been created and reviewed, it is then applied to the target [environment](environments.md) in order for its changes to take effect.

Every time a model is changed as part of a plan, a new variant of this model gets created behind the scenes (a [snapshot](architecture/snapshots.md) with a unique [fingerprint](architecture/snapshots.md#fingerprints) is assigned to it). In turn, each model variant's data is stored in a separate physical table. Data between different variants of the same model is never shared, except for [forward-only](#forward-only-plans) plans.

When a plan is applied to an environment, the environment gets associated with the set of model variants that are part of that plan. In other words, each environment is a collection of references to model variants and the physical tables associated with them.

![Each model variant gets its own physical table, while environments only contain references to these tables](plans/model_versioning.png)

*Each model variant gets its own physical table while environments only contain references to these tables.*

This unique approach to understanding and applying changes is what enables SQLMesh's Virtual Environments. It allows SQLMesh to ensure complete isolation between environments while allowing it to share physical data assets between environments when appropriate and safe to do so.

Additionally, since each model change is captured in a separate physical table, reverting to a previous version becomes a simple and quick operation (refer to [Virtual Update](#virtual-update)) as long as its physical table hasn't been garbage collected by the janitor process.

SQLMesh makes it easy to be correct and really hard to accidentally and irreversibly break things.

### Backfilling
Despite all the benefits, the approach described above is not without trade-offs.

When a new model version is just created, a physical table assigned to it is empty. Therefore, SQLMesh needs to re-apply the logic of the new model version to the entire date range of this model in order to populate the new version's physical table. This process is called backfilling.

We use the term backfilling broadly to describe any situation in which a model is updated. That includes these operations:

* When a VIEW model is created
* When a FULL model is built
* When an INCREMENTAL model is built for the first time
* When an INCREMENTAL model has recent data appended to it
* When an INCREMENTAL model has older data inserted (i.e., resolving a data gap or prepending historical data)

Note for incremental models: despite the fact that backfilling can happen incrementally (see `batch_size` parameter on models), there is an extra cost associated with this operation due to additional runtime involved. If the runtime cost is a concern, use a [forward-only plan](#forward-only-plans) instead.

### Virtual Update
A benefit of SQLMesh's approach is that data for a new model version can be fully pre-built while still in a development environment. That way all changes and their downstream dependencies can be fully previewed before they are promoted to the production environment.

With this approach, the process of promoting a change to production is reduced to reference swapping.

If during plan creation no data gaps have been detected and only references to new model versions need to be updated, then the update is referred to as a Virtual Update. Virtual Updates impose no additional runtime overhead or cost.

### Start and end dates

The `plan` command provides two temporal options: `--start` and `--end`. These options are only applicable to plans for non-prod environments.

For context, every model has a start date. The start can be specified in [the model definition](./models/overview.md#start), in the [project configuration's `model_defaults`](../guides/configuration.md#model-defaults), or by SQLMesh's default value of yesterday.

Because the prod environment supports business operations, prod plans ensure every model is backfilled from its start date until the most recent completed time interval. Due to that restriction, the `plan` command's `--start` and `--end` options are not supported for regular plans against prod. The options are supported for [restatement plans](#restatement-plans) against prod to allow re-processing a subset of existing data.

Non-prod plans are typically used for development, so their models can optionally be backfilled for any date range with the `--start` and `--end` options. Limiting the date range makes backfills faster and development more efficient, especially for incremental models using large tables.

#### Model kind limitations

Some model kinds do not support backfilling a limited date range.

For context, SQLMesh strives to make models _idempotent_, meaning that if we ran them multiple times we would get the same correct result every time.

However, some model kinds are inherently non-idempotent:

- [INCREMENTAL_BY_UNIQUE_KEY](models/model_kinds.md#incremental_by_unique_key)
- [INCREMENTAL_BY_PARTITION](models/model_kinds.md#incremental_by_partition)
- [SCD_TYPE_2_BY_TIME](models/model_kinds.md#scd-type-2-by-time-recommended)
- [SCD_TYPE_2_BY_COLUMN](models/model_kinds.md#scd-type-2-by-column)
- Any model whose query is self-referential (i.e., the contents of new data rows are affected by the data rows already present in the table)

Those model kinds will behave as follows in a non-prod plan that specifies a limited date range:

- If the `--start` option date is the same as or before the model's start date, the model is fully refreshed for all of time
- If the `--start` option date is after the model's start date, the model is ignored by the plan and is not backfilled

#### Example

Consider a SQLMesh project with a default start date of 2024-09-20.

It contains the following `INCREMENTAL_BY_UNIQUE_KEY` model that specifies an explicit start date of 2024-09-23:

```sql linenums="1" hl_lines="6"
MODEL (
  name sqlmesh_example.start_end_model,
  kind INCREMENTAL_BY_UNIQUE_KEY (
    unique_key item_id
  ),
  start '2024-09-23'
);

SELECT
  item_id,
  num_orders
FROM
  sqlmesh_example.full_model
```

When we run the project's first plan, we see that SQLMesh correctly detected a different start date for our `start_end_model` than the other models (which have the project default start of 2024-09-20):

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="17"
❯ sqlmesh plan

After executing that plan, we add columns to both the `incremental_model` and `start_end_model` queries.

We then execute `sqlmesh plan dev` to create the new `dev` environment:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="23-26"

❯ sqlmesh plan dev

Enter the backfill start date (eg. '1 year', '2020-01-01') or blank to backfill from the beginning of history:
```

Note two things about the output:

1. As before, SQLMesh displays the complete backfill time range for each model, using the project default start of 2024-09-20 for `incremental_model` and 2024-09-23 for `start_end_model`
2. SQLMesh prompted us for a backfill start date because we didn't pass the `--start` option to the `sqlmesh plan dev` command

Let's cancel that plan and start a new one, passing a start date of 2024-09-24.

The `start_end_model` is of kind `INCREMENTAL_BY_UNIQUE_KEY`, which is non-idempotent and cannot be backfilled for a limited time range.

Because the command's `--start` of 2024-09-24 is after `start_end_model`'s start date 2024-09-23, `start_end_model` is ignored:

``` bash linenums="1" hl_lines="12-13 20-21"

```

The plan output contains a new `Ignored Models` entry telling us that `sqlmesh_example__dev.start_end_model` was ignored.

It also displays the expected plan start date `2024-09-23`, which is the date our `--start` should include if we want the model to be included in the plan.

Because it is ignored, `start_end_model` is not in the list of `Models needing backfill` at the bottom.

### Data preview for forward-only changes
As mentioned earlier, the data output produced by [forward-only changes](#forward-only-change) in a development environment can only be used for preview and will not be reused in production.

The same holds true for any subsequent changes that depend on undeployed forward-only changes - data can be previewed but can't be reused in production.

Backfills that are exclusively for preview purposes and will not be reused upon deployment to production are explicitly labeled with `(preview)` in the plan summary:
```bash
Models needing backfill (missing dates):
├── sushi__dev.customers: 2023-12-22 - 2023-12-28 (preview)
├── sushi__dev.waiter_revenue_by_day: 2023-12-22 - 2023-12-28
├── sushi__dev.top_waiters: 2023-12-22 - 2023-12-28
└── sushi__dev.waiter_as_customer_by_day: 2023-12-22 - 2023-12-28 (preview)
```

## Forward-only plans
Sometimes the runtime cost associated with rebuilding an entire physical table is too high and outweighs the benefits a separate table provides. This is when a forward-only plan comes in handy.

When a forward-only plan is applied to the `prod` environment, none of the plan's changed models will have new physical tables created for them. Instead, physical tables from previous model versions are reused.

The benefit of this is that no backfilling is required, so there is no runtime overhead or cost. The drawback is that reverting to a previous version is no longer simple and requires a combination of additional forward-only changes and [restatements](#restatement-plans).

Note that once a forward-only change is applied to `prod`, all development environments that referred to the previous versions of the updated models will be impacted.

A core component of the development process is to execute code and verify its behavior. To enable this while preserving isolation between environments, `sqlmesh plan [environment name]` evaluates code in non-`prod` environments while targeting shallow (a.k.a. "zero-copy") clones of production tables for engines that support them or newly created temporary physical tables for engines that don't.

This means that only a limited preview of changes is available in the development environment before the change is promoted to `prod`. The date range of the preview is provided as part of plan creation command.

Engines for which table cloning is supported include:

* `BigQuery`
* `Databricks`
* `Snowflake`

Note that all changes made as part of a forward-only plan automatically get a **forward-only** category assigned to them. These types of changes can't be mixed together with [breaking and non-breaking changes](#change-categories) within the same plan.

To create a forward-only plan, add the `--forward-only` option to the `plan` command:
```bash
sqlmesh plan [environment name] --forward-only
```

!!! note
    The `--forward-only` flag is not required when applying changes to models that have been explicitly configured as [forward-only](models/overview.md#forward_only).

    Use it only if you need to provide a time range for the preview window or the [effective date](#effective-date).

### Destructive changes

Some model changes destroy existing data in a table. SQLMesh automatically detects and optionally prevents destructive changes to [forward-only models](../guides/incremental_time.md#forward-only-models) - learn more [here](../guides/incremental_time.md#destructive-changes).

Forward-only plans treats all of the plan's model changes as forward-only. In these plans, SQLMesh will check all modified incremental models for destructive schema changes, not just forward-only models.

SQLMesh determines what to do for each model based on this setting hierarchy: the [model's `on_destructive_change` value](../guides/incremental_time.md#destructive-changes) (if present), the `on_destructive_change` [model defaults](../reference/model_configuration.md#model-defaults) value (if present), and the SQLMesh global default of `error`.

If you want to temporarily allow destructive changes to models that don't allow them, use the `plan` command's `--allow-destructive-change` selector to specify which models. Learn more about model selectors [here](../guides/model_selection.md).

### Effective date
Changes that are part of the forward-only plan can also be applied retroactively to the production environment by specifying the effective date:

```bash
sqlmesh plan --forward-only --effective-from 2023-01-01
```

This way SQLMesh will know to recompute data intervals starting from the specified date once forward-only changes are deployed to production.

## Restatement plans

Models sometimes need to be re-evaluated for a given time range, even though the model definition has not changed.

This could be due to an upstream issue with a dataset defined outside of SQLMesh, or when a [forward-only plan](#forward-only-plans) change needs to be applied retroactively to a bounded interval of historical data.

For this reason, the `plan` command supports the `--restate-model` selector, which allows specifying one or more model names or tags (using `tag:<tag name>` syntax) to be reprocessed. These can also refer to an external table defined outside SQLMesh.

Applying a plan will trigger a cascading backfill for all specified models (other than external tables), as well as all models downstream from them. The plan's date range determines the data intervals that will be affected (learn more about the limitations of some model kinds [below](#model-kind-limitations)).

To prevent models from ever being restated, set the [disable_restatement](models/overview.md#disable_restatement) attribute to `true`.

See examples below for how to restate both based on model names and model tags.

=== "Names Only"

    ```bash
    sqlmesh plan --restate-model "db.model_a" --restate-model "tag:expensive"
    ```

=== "Upstream"

    ```bash
    # All selected models (including upstream models) will also include their downstream models
    sqlmesh plan --restate-model "+db.model_a" --restate-model "tag:+expensive"
    ```

=== "Wildcards"

    ```bash
    sqlmesh plan --restate-model "db*" --restate-model "tag:exp*"
    ```

=== "Upstream + Wildcards"

    ```bash
    sqlmesh plan --restate-model "+db*" --restate-model "tag:+exp*"
    ```
