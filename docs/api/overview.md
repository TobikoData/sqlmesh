# Overview

SQLMesh can be used with a [cli](cli.md), [notebook](notebook.md), or directly through [Python](python.md). Each interface aims to have parity in both functionality and arguments.

## plan
Plan is the main command of SQLMesh. It allows you to interactively create a migration plan, understand the downstream impact, and apply it. All changes to models and environments are materialized through plan.

Read more about [plan](/concepts/plans).

## evaluate

## fetchdf

## test

## audit
