# Installation


It is recommended, but not required, that you use a python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .env
```
```bash
source .env/bin/activate
```

Install SQLMesh using `pip`:
```bash
pip install sqlmesh
```

## Next steps
* Jump right in with the [quickstart example project](quick_start.md).
* Have an existing dbt project? [Check out SQLMesh's dbt adapter](./integrations/dbt.md).
