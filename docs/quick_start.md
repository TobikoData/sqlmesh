# Quickstart

Welcome to the SQLMesh quickstart, which will get you up and running with an example project.

The example project runs locally on your machine with a DuckDB SQL engine, and SQLMesh will generate all the necessary project files - no configuration necessary!

All you need to do is install SQLMesh on your machine - get started by ensuring your system meets the basic [prerequisites for using SQLMesh](./prerequisites.md).
