# Prerequisites

You'll need Python 3.7 or higher to use SQLMesh. You can check your python version by running the following command:
```
python3 --version
```

or:

```
python --version
```

**Note:** If `python --version` returns 2.x, replace all `python` commands with `python3`, and `pip` with `pip3`.
