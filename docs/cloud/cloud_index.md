# **Welcome to Tobiko Cloud**

**What it is:** 

Tobiko Cloud is a cutting-edge data transformation platform that enhances speed, accuracy, and efficiency in managing data pipelines, offering features like virtual environments, data validation, and seamless integrations.

**Who it’s for:** 

It is designed for developers, data engineers, and enterprises looking to scale their data operations without compromising productivity or precision.

**Why we made it:** 

Tobiko Cloud was created to solve common challenges in data management, such as slow builds, redundant processes, and debugging inefficiencies, empowering teams to deliver reliable data faster. 

### How is it different?

[Tobiko Data's cloud solution](https://tobikodata.com/product.html) differs from SQLMesh's open-source framework in its management and accessibility. It was designed to enhance the SQLMesh experience and extend to companies that are in need of larger enterprise level features, such as additional scalability, observability and cost optimization. Here’s a comparison:

1. **Focus and Scale**: Tobiko Cloud focuses on simplifying SQLMesh deployment for organizations by offering a managed environment. It provides enterprise-grade hosting and scalability for handling complex data transformations, freeing teams from managing infrastructure themselves. This makes it suitable for organizations seeking a seamless way to scale SQLMesh capabilities. SQLMesh itself, being open-source, is highly customizable but requires teams to manage deployment and infrastructure independently.
2. **Observability and Insights**: Tobiko Cloud includes observability features integrated with SQLMesh to offer deep insights into pipeline versions, changes, and errors. This allows teams to trace root causes of data issues, customize dashboards, and monitor data workflows. SQLMesh, while capable of similar functionality when manually set up properly, doesn’t inherently include a hosted observability tool.
3. **Ease of Use**: Tobiko Cloud integrates SQLMesh with an accessible user interface for developing SQL workflows, managing dependencies, and understanding column-level data lineage. The standalone SQLMesh, while efficient and developer-friendly, relies more heavily on command-line interfaces and direct configuration files.
4. **Cost and Efficiency**: SQLMesh's built-in features like incremental models and virtual data environments reduce computational costs and improve processing speeds. These are available in both the open-source and cloud versions. However, Tobiko Cloud packages these benefits with additional enterprise-level services and support, making it a turnkey solution for companies.

Tobiko Cloud extends SQLMesh by eliminating setup complexity and offering managed services tailored for organizations looking to scale data workflows without the overhead of managing technical infrastructure. <Use the table comparison below to clearly see the difference in the features set between the OS platform and our Cloud product: >
