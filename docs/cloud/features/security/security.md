# Security Overview


At Tobiko, we treat security as a first-class citizen because we know how valuable your data assets are. Our team follows and executes security best practices across each layer of our product. 

## Tobiko Cloud Standard Deployment

Our standard Tobiko Cloud deployment consists of several components that are each responsible for different parts of the product. 

Below is a diagram of the components along with their descriptions.

- **Scheduler**: Orchestrates schedule cadence and hosts state metadata (code versions, logs, cost)
- **Executor**: Applies code changes and runs SQL queries (actual data processing in SQL Engine) and Python models in proper DAG order.
- **Gateway**: Stores authentication credentials for SQL Engine. Secured through encryption.
- **SQL Engine**: Processes and stores data based on the above instructions within the **customerâ€™s** environment.

## Tobiko Cloud Hybrid Deployment

For some customers, our hybrid deployment option is a great fit. It provides a seamless experience with Tobiko Cloud but within your own VPC and infrastructure.  

In a hybrid deployment, Tobiko Cloud does not execute tasks directly with the engine. Instead, it passes tasks to the executors hosted in your environment, which then execute the tasks with the engine. 

Executors are Docker containers that connect to both Tobiko Cloud and your SQL engine. They pull work tasks from the Tobiko Cloud scheduler and execute them with your SQL engine. This is a pull-only mechanism authenticated through an OAuth Client ID/Secret. Whitelist IPs in your network to allow reaching Tobiko Cloud IPs from the executor: 34.28.17.91, 34.136.27.153, 34.136.131.20

- **Scheduler**: Orchestrates schedule cadence and hosts state metadata (code versions, logs, cost). **Never pushes** instructions to executor.
- **Executor**: Appplies code changes and runs SQL queries and Python models in proper DAG order (actual data processing in SQL Engine)
- **Gateway**: Stores authentication credentials for SQL Engine. Secured through your secrets manager or Kubernetes Secrets.
- **SQL Engine**: Processes and stores data based on the above instructions
- **Executor -> Scheduler**: A pull-only mechanism for obtaining work tasks. 
- **Helm Chart**: For production environements, we provide a [Helm chart](../scheduler/hybrid_executors_helm.md) that includes robust configurability, secret management, and scaling options.
- **Docker Compose**: For simpler environments or testing, we offer a [Docker Compose setup](../scheduler/hybrid_executors_docker_compose.md) to quickly deploy executors on any machine with Docker.



## Internal Code Practices

We enforce coding standards throughout Tobiko to write, maintain, and collaborate on code effectively. These practice ensure consistency, maintainability, reliability, and most importantly, trust. 

A few key components of our internal code requirements:

- We used signed Git commits, required approvers, and signed Docker artifacts.
- Each commit to a `main` branch must be approved by someone other than the author.
- We sign commits and register the key with GitHub ([Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)).
- Binaries are signed using cosign and OIDC for keyless ([Signing docs](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/)).
- Attestations are created to certify an image, enforced with GCP Binary Authorization ([Attestation docs](https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization/docs/key-concepts#attestations)).
- Encryption is a key feature of our security posture and is enforced at each stage of access. For example, the state database automatically encrypts all data. Credentials are also securely encrypted and stored. 
- We back up each state database nightly and before upgrades. These backups are stored for 14 days.

## Penetration Testing

At least once a year, Tobiko engages a third-party security firm to perform a penetration test. This test evaluates our systems by identifying and attempting to exploit known vulnerabilities, focusing on critical external and/or internal assets. A detailed report is available upon request.
 

## Asset and Access Management 

### How do we protect PGP keys?

If an employee loses their laptop, we don't need to get the old PGP key back because we can invalidate the key directly. 

We use GitHub to sign code commits. At the time the code was committed, the PGP key was valid. When an employee loses their laptop, we will invalidate it, and they will regenerate a new key to use in future commits. The old commits are still valid because the PGP key was valid at the time the commit was made.

### How do we invalidate PGP keys if someone did steal it and could potentially use it?

We would revoke access for the GitHub user account associated with the compromised key and not give it access again until the old PGP key is deprecated and a new key issued.

### If someone steals a laptop, what's our continuity plan in protecting code?

- All employee devices are monitored for proper encryption and password policies.
- Laptop protection is enforced through file encryption via Vanta.
- Mandatory lock screen after a timeout.
- We follow a formal IT asset disposal procedure to prevent key compromise through improper hardware disposal.
- See above for PGP key protection.
- Binaries are signed using Cosign and OIDC for keyless signing.
