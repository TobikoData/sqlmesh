# Overview

Tobiko Cloud implements useful observability by capturing detailed metadata throughout your data project's lifecycle. During the execution of plans and runs, it collects information about data transformations, model performance, and system health to give you complete visibility into your project's operations. 

This observability serves multiple purposes:

- Monitors the health and performance of your data pipelines
- Tracks the status of current and historical runs
- Maintains detailed version history of your models and transformations
- Enables creation of custom visualizations and metrics
- Facilitates troubleshooting and optimization

Observability features are seamlessly integrated throughout the Tobiko Cloud's interface, making it simple to monitor and understand your data project's behaviour. Instead of digging through complex logs or piecing together information from multiple sources, you can quickly access relevant insights from any part of your project. This includes real-time monitoring, historical analysis, and performance metrics that help you maintain reliable and efficient data operations.

The list below provides links to the integrated observability features, so you can find where and how to use/view them.
