# Runs

Run pages, like [plan pages](./plan.md), serve as comprehensive control centres that provide detailed insights into individual runs executed across your various environments. They were created with the same philosophy as the plan pages, providing a consistent user experience and navigation pattern - users navigate to these pages directly from the activity table, just as they would with plan pages, ensuring familiarity and ease of use across the platform. 

These pages act as a central hub where team members can monitor and understand all aspects of a runâ€™s execution, from start to finish. And the runs page can serve as an essential jumping off point for issue investigation and triaging processes whenever runs experience errors or unexpected behavior.

## When you might use this

Data engineers often want to examine the most recent run to verify its status. The run page provides a quick way to check whether a run has succeeded or failed and when exactly it was executed. So you can get a comprehensive view of all model executions and audits that were included in the run.

For those who need deeper insights, the [Debugger View](../debugger_view.md) offers advanced analysis capabilities. This powerful tool allows teams to investigate which models are taking the longest time to update, helping identify potential performance bottlenecks in their data pipelines.

## Navigating to a Run page

Every SQLMesh `run` is applied to a specific environment. To locate a `run`, first navigate to its [Environment page](./development_environment.md).

The environment page's Recent Activity table includes a list of every recent `plan` and `run`. To learn more about a `run`, locate the `run` by application date and click on its blue ID link in the table's final column.

Clicking the link opens the detailed run overview page:

## Summary

The top of the overview page summarizes the `run`, including:

  - `Status`: completion status (completed, in progress, or failed)
  - `When`: start and end times
  - `Changes since previous run`: list of project changes that occurred since the previous `run`

## Details

The lower portion of the page contains a table with three tabs.

`Model Executions`: list of executed models, including completion status, run times, error messages (when applicable), and links to detailed execution logs for troubleshooting

`Audits`: list of audit executions statuses, including completion status, whether the audit is blocking, and links to detailed audit logs for verification

`Explore Executions`: interactive view of executed models, including a lineage graph of model dependencies, and detailed information about impact analysis, model definitions, time intervals processed, and links to associated logs (for more see the [Debugger View page](../debugger_view.md))
