# Incident Reporting

## Overview

Tobiko Cloud has 24/7 monitoring and alerting in place to ensure the platform is running smoothly. 
However, if you encounter any issues, you can report incidents directly through the platform.
This will immediately notify our support team, who will investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

### Reporting an incident using SSO

To report an incident using your Single Sign-On (SSO) account, follow these steps:

* Visit [Tobiko Cloud Incident Reporting Page](https://incidents.tobikodata.com/).
    * You will see your organization's name in the top right corner, indicating that you are logged in with your SSO account.
* Select a severity level for your incident
* Put in the project name that the incident is related to
    * The project name is the name after your organization name in the Cloud UI.
* Write a detailed description of the incident
    * Include any relevant information that can help our support team understand and resolve the issue.
* Click the "Submit" button to send your incident report.
* You will receive a confirmation message indicating that your incident has been reported successfully.
* You should hear from our support team shortly after submitting the incident report.

### Getting URL that doesn't require SSO

Although in most cases SSO is the preferred way to report incidents, it is possible that SSO could be down or not working for some reason.
To prepare for this situation, you can get a URL that doesn't require SSO by following these steps:

* Visit [Tobiko Cloud Incident Reporting Page](https://incidents.tobikodata.com/).
* Click the "Copy Standalone URL" button below the report incident part of the page.
* Save this URL within your organization so that anyone can use it in case SSO is not working.

### If you don't have SSO enabled for your organization

Contact your solution architect and ask them to provide you with a URL that doesn't require SSO.
