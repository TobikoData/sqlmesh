# GitHub

Our Github integration will allow you to add a CI/CD bot to any Github project using Github Actions. 
The bot will automatically run plan/apply to an environment for the pull request that will exactly match the code in the pull request.
This will be done without copying or rebuilding data using the Virtual Data Mart technology. 
Once approved, the CI/CD bot will automatically run plan/apply to the production environment and merge the PR upon completion.
This allows you to have your main branch and prod environments always in sync.

We will be launching this CI/CD bot soon and please leave any feedback or question on our slack channel until then!
