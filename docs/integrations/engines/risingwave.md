## Usage
RisingWave engine has some different features as streaming database. You can create a resource that RisingWave can read data from with `CREATE SOURCE`. You can also create an external target where you can send data processed in RisingWave with `CREATE SINK`.

To use this in SQLMesh, you can refer to optional pre-statements and post-statements as [SQL models doc](https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/models/sql_models/) here specify.

Below is an example of creating sink in SQLMesh models as post-statement.

```sql
MODEL (
    name sqlmesh_example.view_model,
    kind VIEW (
      materialized true
    )
);

SELECT
  item_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS num_orders,
FROM
  sqlmesh_example.incremental_model
GROUP BY item_id;

CREATE
  SINK IF NOT EXISTS kafka_sink
FROM
  @this_model
WITH (
  connector='kafka',
  "properties.bootstrap.server"='localhost:9092',
  topic='test1',
)
FORMAT PLAIN
ENCODE JSON (force_append_only=true);
```

here `@this_model` macro is used to represent "sqlmesh_example.view_model" model.
