# MotherDuck

This page provides information about how to use SQLMesh with MotherDuck. 

It begins with a [Connection Quickstart](#connection-quickstart) that demonstrates how to connect to MotherDuck, or you can skip directly to information about using MotherDuck with the built-in or airflow schedules.

## Connection quickstart

Connecting to cloud warehouses involves a few steps, so this connection quickstart provides the info you need to get up and running with MotherDuck.

It demonstrates connecting to MotherDuck with the `duckdb` library bundled with SQLMesh. 

MotherDuck provides a single way to authorize a connection. This quickstart demonstrates authenticating with a token.

!!! tip  
    This quick start assumes you are familiar with basic SQLMesh commands and functionality.

    If you’re not familiar, work through the [SQLMesh Quickstart](../../quick_start.md) before continuing.  

### Prerequisites

Before working through this quickstart guide, ensure that:

1. You have a motherduck account and an access token.  
2. Your computer has SQLMesh installed with the DuckDB extra available.  
   1. Install from command line with the command `pip install “sqlmesh[duckdb]”`  
3. You have initialized a SQLMesh example project on your computer  
   1. Open a command line interface and navigate to the directory where the project files should go.  
   2. Initialize the project with the command `sqlmesh init motherduck`

#### Access control permissions

SQLMesh must have sufficient permissions to create and access your MotherDuck databases. Since permission is granted to specific databases for a specific user, you should create a service account for SQLMesh that will contain the credentials for writing to MotherDuck.

### Configure the connection

We now have what is required to configure SQLMesh’s connection to MotherDuck.

We start the configuration by adding a gateway named `motherduck` to our example project’s config.yaml file and making it our `default gateway`, as well as adding our token, persistent, and ephemeral catalogs.

```yaml  
gateways:  
    motherduck:  
        connection:   
            type: motherduck  
            catalogs:  
                persistent: ‘md:’  
                ephemeral: ‘:memory:’  
            token: \<your\_token\>

default\_gateway: motherduck  
```

!!! warning
    Best practice for storing secrets like tokens is placing them in [environment variables that the configuration file loads dynamically](../../guides/configuration.md#environment-variables). For simplicity, this guide instead places the value directly in the configuration file.

    This code demonstrates how to use the environment variable `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` for the configuration's `token` parameter:

    ```yaml linenums="1" hl_lines="5"
    gateways:  
        motherduck:  
            connection:   
                type: motherduck  
            token: {{ env_var('MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN') }}
    ```

### Check connection

We have now specified the `motherduck` gateway connection information, so we can confirm that SQLMesh is able to successfully connect to MotherDuck. We will test the connection with the `sqlmesh info` command.

First, open a command line terminal. Now enter the command `sqlmesh info`:

![](./motherduck/sqlmesh_info.png)

The output shows that our data warehouse connection succeeded:

### Run a `sqlmesh plan`

Now we're ready to run a `sqlmesh plan` in MotherDuck:

![](./motherduck/sqlmesh_plan.png)

And confirm that our schemas and objects exist in the MotherDuck catalog:

Congratulations \- your SQLMesh project is up and running on MotherDuck\!
