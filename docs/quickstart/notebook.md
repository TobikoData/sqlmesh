# Notebook

In this quick start guide, you'll use the SQLMesh notebook interface to get up and running with SQLMesh's scaffold generator. This example project will run locally on your computer using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) as an embedded SQL engine.

Before beginning, ensure that you meet all the [prerequisites](../prerequisites.md) for using SQLMesh.

The notebook interface works with both Jupyter and Databricks notebooks. Learn more about configuring a Databricks connection at the [Execution Engines](../integrations/engines/databricks.md) page.

??? info "Learn more about the quickstart project structure"
    This project demonstrates key SQLMesh features by walking through the SQLMesh workflow on a simple data pipeline. This section describes the project structure and the SQLMesh concepts you will encounter as you work through it.

    The project contains three models with a CSV file as the only data source:

    ```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │seed_data.csv│
    └────────────┬┘
                │
                ┌▼─────────────┐
                │seed_model.sql│
                └─────────────┬┘
                            │
                            ┌▼────────────────────┐
                            │incremental_model.sql│
                            └────────────────────┬┘
                                                │
                                                ┌▼─────────────┐
                                                │full_model.sql│
                                                └──────────────┘
    ```

    Although the project is simple, it touches on all the primary concepts needed to use SQLMesh productively.

## 1. Create the SQLMesh project
First, create a SQLMesh project directory with your operating system's graphical or command-line tools. Next, create a Jupyter or Databricks notebook file - it does not need to be in the SQLMesh project directory.

If using a python virtual environment, ensure it's activated first by running the `source .env/bin/activate` command from the folder used during [installation](../installation.md).

Import the SQLMesh library to load the notebook magic commands:

![Cell importing the SQLMesh library](./notebook/nb-quickstart_import.png)

Next, create a SQLMesh scaffold with the `%init` notebook magic, specifying a default SQL dialect for your models. The dialect should correspond to the dialect most of your models are written in; it can be overridden for specific models in the model's `MODEL` specification. All SQL dialects [supported by the SQLGlot library](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/dialects/dialect.py) are allowed.

In this example, we specify the `duckdb` dialect:

![Notebook output after project initiation](./notebook/nb-quickstart_init.png)

If the scaffold is successfully created, it will return `SQLMesh project scaffold created`.

The scaffold will include a SQLMesh configuration file for the example project.

??? info "Learn more about the project's configuration"
    SQLMesh project-level configuration parameters are specified in the `config.yaml` file in the project directory.

    This example project uses the embedded DuckDB SQL engine, so its configuration specifies `duckdb` as the local gateway's connection and the `local` gateway as the default.

    The command to run the scaffold generator **requires** a default SQL dialect for your models, which it places in the config `model_defaults` `dialect` key. In this example, we specified the `duckdb` SQL dialect as the default:

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    gateways:
        local:
            connection:
                type: duckdb
                database: ./db.db

    default_gateway: local

    model_defaults:
        dialect: duckdb
    ```

    Learn more about SQLMesh project configuration [here](../reference/configuration.md).

The scaffold will also include multiple directories where SQLMesh project files are stored and multiple files that constitute the example project (e.g., SQL models).

??? info "Learn more about the project directories and files"
    SQLMesh uses a scaffold generator to initiate a new project. The generator will create multiple sub-directories and files for organizing your SQLMesh project code.

    The scaffold generator will create the following configuration file and directories:

    - config.yaml
        - The file for project configuration. Refer to [configuration](../reference/configuration.md).
    - ./models
        - SQL and Python models. Refer to [models](../concepts/models/overview.md).
    - ./seeds
        - Seed files. Refer to [seeds](../concepts/models/seed_models.md).
    - ./audits
        - Shared audit files. Refer to [auditing](../concepts/audits.md).
    - ./tests
        - Unit test files. Refer to [testing](../concepts/tests.md).
    - ./macros
        - Macro files. Refer to [macros](../concepts/macros/overview.md).

    It will also create the files needed for this quickstart example:

    - ./models
        - full_model.sql
        - incremental_model.sql
        - seed_model.sql
    - ./seeds
        - seed_data.csv
    - ./audits
        - assert_positive_order_ids.sql
    - ./tests
        - test_full_model.yaml

Finally, the scaffold will include data for the example project to use.

??? info "Learn more about the project's data"
    The data used in this example project is contained in the `seed_data.csv` file in the `/seeds` project directory. The data reflects sales of 3 items over 7 days in January 2020.

    The file contains three columns, `id`, `item_id`, and `ds`, which correspond to each row's unique ID, the sold item's ID number, and the date the item was sold, respectively.

    This is the complete dataset:

    | id | item_id | ds         |
    | -- | ------- | ---------- |
    | 1  | 2       | 2020-01-01 |
    | 2  | 1       | 2020-01-01 |
    | 3  | 3       | 2020-01-03 |
    | 4  | 1       | 2020-01-04 |
    | 5  | 1       | 2020-01-05 |
    | 6  | 1       | 2020-01-06 |
    | 7  | 1       | 2020-01-07 |

Inform SQLMesh of the project location by setting a context with the `%context` notebook magic. If the context is set successfully, it will return a message including the repository or list of repositories:

![Notebook output after setting SQLMesh context](./notebook/nb-quickstart_context.png)

You can specify multiple directories in one call to `%context` if your SQLMesh project has [multiple repositories](../guides/multi_repo.md).

## 2. Create a prod environment

SQLMesh's key actions are creating and applying *plans* to *environments*. At this point, the only environment is the empty `prod` environment.

??? info "Learn more about SQLMesh plans and environments"

    SQLMesh's key actions are creating and applying *plans* to *environments*.

    A [SQLMesh environment](../concepts/environments.md) is an isolated namespace containing models and the data they generated. The most important environment is `prod` ("production"), which consists of the databases behind the applications your business uses to operate each day. Environments other than `prod` provide a place where you can test and preview changes to model code before they go live and affect business operations.

    A [SQLMesh plan](../concepts/plans.md) contains a comparison of one environment to another and the set of changes needed to bring them into alignment. For example, if a new SQL model was added, tested, and run in the `dev` environment, it would need to be added and run in the `prod` environment to bring them into alignment. SQLMesh identifies all such changes and classifies them as either breaking or non-breaking.

    Breaking changes are those that invalidate data already existing in an environment. For example, if a `WHERE` clause was added to a model in the `dev` environment, existing data created by that model in the `prod` environment are now invalid because they may contain rows that would be filtered out by the new `WHERE` clause. Other changes, like adding a new column to a model in `dev`, are non-breaking because all the existing data in `prod` are still valid to use - only new data must be added to align the environments.

    After SQLMesh creates a plan, it summarizes the breaking and non-breaking changes so you can understand what will happen if you apply the plan. It will prompt you to "backfill" data to apply the plan - in this context, backfill is a generic term for updating or adding to a table's data (including an initial load or full refresh).

The first SQLMesh plan must execute every model to populate the production environment. Running the notebook magic `%plan` will generate the plan and the following output:

![Notebook output after plan creation](./notebook/nb-quickstart_plan.png)

The first block of output notes that `%plan` successfully executed the project's test `tests/test_full_model.yaml` with duckdb.

The `New environment` line describes what environments the plan will affect when applied - a new `prod` environment in this case.

The `Summary of differences` section shows that SQLMesh detected three new models relative to the current empty environment.

The `Models needing backfill` section lists each model that will be executed by the plan, along with the date intervals that will be run. Both `full_model` and `incremental_model` show `2020-01-01` as their start date because:

1. The incremental model specifies that date in the `start` property of its `MODEL` statement and
2. The full model depends on the incremental model.

The `seed_model` date range begins on the same day the plan was made because `SEED` models have no temporality associated with them other than whether they have been modified since the previous SQLMesh plan.

??? info "Learn more about the project's models"

    A plan's actions are determined by the [kinds](../concepts/models/model_kinds.md) of models the project uses. This example project uses three model kinds:

    1. [`SEED` models](../concepts/models/model_kinds.md#seed) read data from CSV files stored in the SQLMesh project directory.
    2. [`FULL` models](../concepts/models/model_kinds.md#full) fully refresh (rewrite) the data associated with the model every time the model is run.
    3. [`INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE` models](../concepts/models/model_kinds.md#incremental_by_time_range) use a date/time data column to track which time intervals are affected by a plan and process only the affected intervals when a model is run.

    We now briefly review each model in the project.

    The first model is a `SEED` model that imports `seed_data.csv`. This model consists of only a `MODEL` statement because `SEED` models do not query a database.

    In addition to specifying the model name and CSV path relative to the model file, it includes the column names and data types of the columns in the CSV. It also sets the `grain` of the model to the columns that collectively form the model's unique identifier, `id` and `ds`.

    ```sql linenums="1"
    MODEL (
        name sqlmesh_example.seed_model,
        kind SEED (
            path '../seeds/seed_data.csv'
        ),
        columns (
            id INTEGER,
            item_id INTEGER,
            ds VARCHAR
        ),
        grain [id, ds]
    );
    ```

    The second model is an `INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE` model that includes both a `MODEL` statement and a SQL query selecting from the first seed model.

    The `MODEL` statement's `kind` property includes the required specification of the data column containing each record's timestamp. It also includes the optional `start` property specifying the earliest date/time for which the model should process data and the `cron` property specifying that the model should run daily. It sets the model's grain to columns `id` and `ds`.

    The SQL query includes a `WHERE` clause that SQLMesh uses to filter the data to a specific date/time interval when loading data incrementally:

    ```sql linenums="1"
    MODEL (
        name sqlmesh_example.incremental_model,
        kind INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE (
            time_column ds
        ),
        start '2020-01-01',
        cron '@daily',
        grain [id, ds]
    );

    SELECT
        id,
        item_id,
        ds,
    FROM
        sqlmesh_example.seed_model
    WHERE
        ds between @start_ds and @end_ds
    ```

    The final model in the project is a `FULL` model. In addition to properties used in the other models, its `MODEL` statement includes the [`audits`](../concepts/audits.md) property. The project includes a custom `assert_positive_order_ids` audit in the project `audits` directory; it verifies that all `item_id` values are positive numbers. It will be run every time the model is executed.

    ```sql linenums="1"
    MODEL (
        name sqlmesh_example.full_model,
        kind FULL,
        cron '@daily',
        grain item_id,
        audits [assert_positive_order_ids],
    );

    SELECT
        item_id,
        count(distinct id) AS num_orders,
    FROM
        sqlmesh_example.incremental_model
    GROUP BY item_id
    ```

Click the green button labeled `Apply - Backfill Tables` to apply the plan and initiate backfill. The following output will be displayed:

![Notebook output after plan application](./notebook/nb-quickstart_apply-plan.png)

The first output block shows the completion percentage and run time for each model (very fast in this simple example). The following line shows that the `prod` environment now points to the tables created during model execution.

You've now created a new production environment with all of history backfilled.

## 3. Update a model

Now that we have have populated the `prod` environment, let's modify one of the SQL models.

We can modify the incremental SQL model using the `%model` *line* notebook magic (note the single `%`) and the model name:

![%model line magic for sqlmesh_example.incremental_model](./notebook/nb-quickstart_model-line.png)

After we execute the cell, the contents will be replaced by the `%%model` *cell* notebook magic (note the double `%%`) and the model contents, along with a rendered version of the model SQL query. SQLMesh has automatically added explicit column aliases to the query (e.g., `id AS id`):

![%%model cell magic for sqlmesh_example.incremental_model](./notebook/nb-quickstart_model-cell.png)

We modify the incremental SQL model by adding a new column to the query. When we execute the cell it will write the updated model contents to the file and update the rendered version of the query:

![%%model cell magic for updated sqlmesh_example.incremental_model](./notebook/nb-quickstart_model-cell-updated.png)

## 4. Work with a development environment

### 4.1 Create a dev environment
Now that you've modified a model, it's time to create a development environment so that you can validate the model change without affecting production.

Run `%plan dev` to create a development environment called `dev`. The following output will be displayed:

![Notebook output after dev plan creation](./notebook/nb-quickstart_plan-dev.png)

The first block of output notes that `%plan` successfully executed the project's test `tests/test_full_model.yaml` with duckdb.

The `New environment` line describes what environments the plan will affect when applied - a new `dev` environment will be created from the existing `prod` environment.

The `Summary of differences` section summarizes the differences between the modified model and the new `dev` environment (right now just a copy of `prod`), detecting that we directly modified `incremental_model` and that `full_model` was indirectly modified because it selects from the incremental model. It shows a diff between the existing and updated model.

SQLMesh automatically classified the change as `Non-breaking` because understood that the change was additive (added a column not used by `full_model`) and did not invalidate any data already in `prod`.

The `Models needing backfill` section shows that only the directly modified `incremental_model` needs backfill and provides a date picker to specify the start and end dates for the backfill.

Click the green button to perform the backfill:

![Notebook output after dev plan application](./notebook/nb-quickstart_apply-plan-dev.png)

The output shows that SQLMesh created a new model version in `dev`. The last line of the output shows that SQLMesh applied the change to `sqlmesh_example__dev.incremental_model`. In the model schema, the suffix "`__dev`" indicates that it is in the `dev` environment.

SQLMesh did not need to backfill anything for the `full_model` since the change was `Non-breaking`.

### 4.2 Validate updates in dev
You can now view this change by querying data from `incremental_model` with the `%%fetchdf` *cell* magic (note the two `%` symbols) and the SQL query `select * from sqlmesh_example__dev.incremental_model`.

Note that the environment name `__dev` is appended to the schema namespace `sqlmesh_example` in the query:

![Notebook output after executing %%fetchdf on `dev` incremental_model](./notebook/nb-quickstart_fetchdf-dev.png)

You can see that `new_column` was added to the dataset.

The production table was not modified; you can validate this by querying the production table using `%%fetchdf` and the query `select * from sqlmesh_example.incremental_model`.

Note that nothing has been appended to the schema namespace `sqlmesh_example` because `prod` is the default environment:

![Notebook output after executing %%fetchdf on prod incremental_model before model update applied](./notebook/nb-quickstart_fetchdf-prod.png)

The production table does not have `new_column` because the changes to `dev` have not yet been applied to `prod`.

## 5. Update the prod environment
Now that we've tested the changes in dev, it's time to move them to production. Run `%plan` to plan and apply your changes to the `prod` environment:

![Notebook output after executing %plan on prod](./notebook/nb-quickstart_apply-plan-prod-modified.png)

Click the green `Apply - Virtual Update` button to apply the plan and execute the backfill:

![Notebook output after executing applying virtual update on prod](./notebook/nb-quickstart_apply-plan-prod-modified-update.png)

Note that a backfill was not necessary and only a Virtual Update occurred.

### 5.2 Validate updates in prod
Double-check that the data updated in `prod` by running `%%fetchdf` with the SQL query `select * from sqlmesh_example.incremental_model`:

![Notebook output after executing %%fetchdf on prod incremental_model after model update applied](./notebook/nb-quickstart_fetchdf-prod-modified.png)

`new_column` is now present in the `prod` incremental model.
