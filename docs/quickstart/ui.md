# Browser UI

In this quick start guide, you'll use the SQLMesh browser user interface to get up and running with SQLMesh's scaffold generator. This example project will run locally on your computer using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) as an embedded SQL engine.

??? info "Learn more about the quickstart project structure"
    This project demonstrates key SQLMesh features by walking through the SQLMesh workflow on a simple data pipeline. This section describes the project structure and the SQLMesh concepts you will encounter as you work through it.

    The project contains three models with a CSV file as the only data source:

    ```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │seed_data.csv│
    └────────────┬┘
                │
                ┌▼─────────────┐
                │seed_model.sql│
                └─────────────┬┘
                            │
                            ┌▼────────────────────┐
                            │incremental_model.sql│
                            └────────────────────┬┘
                                                │
                                                ┌▼─────────────┐
                                                │full_model.sql│
                                                └──────────────┘
    ```

    Although the project is simple, it touches on all the primary concepts needed to use SQLMesh productively.

## Setup

Before beginning, ensure that you meet all the [prerequisites](../prerequisites.md) for using SQLMesh. The SQLMesh browser UI requires additional Python libraries not included in the base SQLMesh installation.

To use the UI, install SQLMesh with the `web` add-on. First, if using a python virtual environment, ensure it's activated by running `source .env/bin/activate` command from the folder used during [installation](../installation.md).

Next, install the UI with `pip`:

```bash
pip install "sqlmesh[web]"
```

## 1. Create the SQLMesh project
Before working in the SQLMesh browser UI, create a project directory with your operating system's graphical interface or from the command line:

```bash
mkdir sqlmesh-example
```

Navigate to the directory on the command line:

```bash
cd sqlmesh-example
```

If using a python virtual environment, ensure it's activated by running `source .env/bin/activate` from the folder used during [installation](../installation.md).

Create a SQLMesh scaffold with the following command, specifying a default SQL dialect for your models. The dialect should correspond to the dialect most of your models are written in; it can be overridden for specific models in the model's `MODEL` specification. All SQL dialects [supported by the SQLGlot library](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/dialects/dialect.py) are allowed.

In this example, we specify the `duckdb` dialect:

```bash
sqlmesh init duckdb
```

The scaffold will include a SQLMesh configuration file for the example project.

??? info "Learn more about the project's configuration"
    SQLMesh project-level configuration parameters are specified in the `config.yaml` file in the project directory.

    This example project uses the embedded DuckDB SQL engine, so its configuration specifies `duckdb` as the local gateway's connection and the `local` gateway as the default.

    The command to run the scaffold generator **requires** a default SQL dialect for your models, which it places in the config `model_defaults` `dialect` key. In this example, we specified the `duckdb` SQL dialect as the default:

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    gateways:
        local:
            connection:
                type: duckdb
                database: ./db.db

    default_gateway: local

    model_defaults:
        dialect: duckdb
    ```

    Learn more about SQLMesh project configuration [here](../reference/configuration.md).

The scaffold will also include multiple directories where SQLMesh project files are stored and multiple files that constitute the example project (e.g., SQL models).

??? info "Learn more about the project directories and files"
    SQLMesh uses a scaffold generator to initiate a new project. The generator will create multiple sub-directories and files for organizing your SQLMesh project code.

    The scaffold generator will create the following configuration file and directories:

    - config.yaml
        - The file for project configuration. Refer to [configuration](../reference/configuration.md).
    - ./models
        - SQL and Python models. Refer to [models](../concepts/models/overview.md).
    - ./seeds
        - Seed files. Refer to [seeds](../concepts/models/seed_models.md).
    - ./audits
        - Shared audit files. Refer to [auditing](../concepts/audits.md).
    - ./tests
        - Unit test files. Refer to [testing](../concepts/tests.md).
    - ./macros
        - Macro files. Refer to [macros](../concepts/macros/overview.md).

    It will also create the files needed for this quickstart example:

    - ./models
        - full_model.sql
        - incremental_model.sql
        - seed_model.sql
    - ./seeds
        - seed_data.csv
    - ./audits
        - assert_positive_order_ids.sql
    - ./tests
        - test_full_model.yaml

Finally, the scaffold will include data for the example project to use.

??? info "Learn more about the project's data"
    The data used in this example project is contained in the `seed_data.csv` file in the `/seeds` project directory. The data reflects sales of 3 items over 7 days in January 2020.

    The file contains three columns, `id`, `item_id`, and `ds`, which correspond to each row's unique ID, the sold item's ID number, and the date the item was sold, respectively.

    This is the complete dataset:

    | id | item_id | ds         |
    | -- | ------- | ---------- |
    | 1  | 2       | 2020-01-01 |
    | 2  | 1       | 2020-01-01 |
    | 3  | 3       | 2020-01-03 |
    | 4  | 1       | 2020-01-04 |
    | 5  | 1       | 2020-01-05 |
    | 6  | 1       | 2020-01-06 |
    | 7  | 1       | 2020-01-07 |

## 2. Open the SQLMesh web UI

Open the UI by running the `sqlmesh ui` command from within the project directory:

```bash
sqlmesh ui
```

After starting up, the SQLMesh web UI is served at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default:

![SQLMesh web UI startup on CLI](./ui/ui-quickstart_cli.png)

Navigate to the URL by clicking the link in your terminal (if supported) or copy-pasting it into your web browser:

![SQLMesh web UI startup in browser](./ui/ui-quickstart_ui-startup.png)

The SQLMesh UI default view contains five panes:

1. Project directory allows navigation of project directories and files.
2. Editor tabs displays open code editors.
3. Code editor allows viewing and editing code files.
4. Inspector provides settings and information based on recent actions and the currently active pane.
5. Details displays results of queries.

![SQLMesh web UI panes](./ui/ui-quickstart_ui-startup-panes.png)

It also contains five buttons:

1. Add new tab opens a new code editor window.
2. Toggle Editor/Docs view toggles between the Code Editor (default) and Docs views.
3. Run plan command executes the [`sqlmesh plan` command](../reference/cli.md#plan).
4. Run query command executes the [`sqlmesh fetchdf` command](../reference/cli.md#fetchdf).
5. Change SQL dialect specifies the SQL dialect of the current tab for custom SQL queries. It does not affect the SQL dialect for the project.

![SQLMesh web UI buttons](./ui/ui-quickstart_ui-startup-buttons.png)

The default view contains three status indicators:

1. Editor tab language displays the programming language of the current code editor tab (SQL or Python).
2. Change indicator displays a summary of the changes in the most recently run SQLMesh plan.
3. Error indicator displays the count of errors that occurred in the most recently run SQLMesh plan.

![SQLMesh web UI status indicators](./ui/ui-quickstart_ui-startup-status.png)

## 3. Plan and apply environments
### 3.1 Create a prod environment

SQLMesh's key actions are creating and applying *plans* to *environments*. At this point, the only environment is the empty `prod` environment.

??? info "Learn more about SQLMesh plans and environments"

    SQLMesh's key actions are creating and applying *plans* to *environments*.

    A [SQLMesh environment](../concepts/environments.md) is an isolated namespace containing models and the data they generated. The most important environment is `prod` ("production"), which consists of the databases behind the applications your business uses to operate each day. Environments other than `prod` provide a place where you can test and preview changes to model code before they go live and affect business operations.

    A [SQLMesh plan](../concepts/plans.md) contains a comparison of one environment to another and the set of changes needed to bring them into alignment. For example, if a new SQL model was added, tested, and run in the `dev` environment, it would need to be added and run in the `prod` environment to bring them into alignment. SQLMesh identifies all such changes and classifies them as either breaking or non-breaking.

    Breaking changes are those that invalidate data already existing in an environment. For example, if a `WHERE` clause was added to a model in the `dev` environment, existing data created by that model in the `prod` environment are now invalid because they may contain rows that would be filtered out by the new `WHERE` clause. Other changes, like adding a new column to a model in `dev`, are non-breaking because all the existing data in `prod` are still valid to use - only new data must be added to align the environments.

    After SQLMesh creates a plan, it summarizes the breaking and non-breaking changes so you can understand what will happen if you apply the plan. It will prompt you to "backfill" data to apply the plan - in this context, backfill is a generic term for updating or adding to a table's data (including an initial load or full refresh).

The first SQLMesh plan must execute every model to populate the production environment. Click the blue `Run Plan` button in the top right, and a new pane will open on the right side.

The pane contains multiple pieces of information about the plan:

- The pane title on the top left states that the plan's target environment is `prod`. The error indicator on the top right shows that the plan has no errors associated with it.
- The `Initializing Prod Environment` section shows that the plan is initializing the `prod` environment.
- The `Tests` section notes that the plan successfully executed the project's test `tests/test_full_model.yaml` with duckdb.
- The `Models` section shows that SQLMesh detected three new models added relative to the current empty environment.
- In the `Backfill` section, the `Needs Backfill` sub-section lists each model that will be executed by the plan, along with the date intervals that will be run. Both `full_model` and `incremental_model` show `2020-01-01` as their start date because:

    1. The incremental model specifies that date in the `start` property of its `MODEL` statement and
    2. The full model depends on the incremental model

    The `seed_model` date range begins on the same day the plan was made because `SEED` models have no temporality associated with them other than whether they have been modified since the previous SQLMesh plan.

??? info "Learn more about the project's models"

    A plan's actions are determined by the [kinds](../concepts/models/model_kinds.md) of models the project uses. This example project uses three model kinds:

    1. [`SEED` models](../concepts/models/model_kinds.md#seed) read data from CSV files stored in the SQLMesh project directory.
    2. [`FULL` models](../concepts/models/model_kinds.md#full) fully refresh (rewrite) the data associated with the model every time the model is run.
    3. [`INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE` models](../concepts/models/model_kinds.md#incremental_by_time_range) use a date/time data column to track which time intervals are affected by a plan and process only the affected intervals when a model is run.

    We now briefly review each model in the project.

    The first model is a `SEED` model that imports `seed_data.csv`. This model consists of only a `MODEL` statement because `SEED` models do not query a database.

    In addition to specifying the model name and CSV path relative to the model file, it includes the column names and data types of the columns in the CSV. It also sets the `grain` of the model to the columns that collectively form the model's unique identifier, `id` and `ds`.

    ```sql linenums="1"
    MODEL (
        name sqlmesh_example.seed_model,
        kind SEED (
            path '../seeds/seed_data.csv'
        ),
        columns (
            id INTEGER,
            item_id INTEGER,
            ds VARCHAR
        ),
        grain [id, ds]
    );
    ```

    The second model is an `INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE` model that includes both a `MODEL` statement and a SQL query selecting from the first seed model.

    The `MODEL` statement's `kind` property includes the required specification of the data column containing each record's timestamp. It also includes the optional `start` property specifying the earliest date/time for which the model should process data and the `cron` property specifying that the model should run daily. It sets the model's grain to columns `id` and `ds`.

    The SQL query includes a `WHERE` clause that SQLMesh uses to filter the data to a specific date/time interval when loading data incrementally:

    ```sql linenums="1"
    MODEL (
        name sqlmesh_example.incremental_model,
        kind INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE (
            time_column ds
        ),
        start '2020-01-01',
        cron '@daily',
        grain [id, ds]
    );

    SELECT
        id,
        item_id,
        ds,
    FROM
        sqlmesh_example.seed_model
    WHERE
        ds between @start_ds and @end_ds
    ```

    The final model in the project is a `FULL` model. In addition to properties used in the other models, its `MODEL` statement includes the [`audits`](../concepts/audits.md) property. The project includes a custom `assert_positive_order_ids` audit in the project `audits` directory; it verifies that all `item_id` values are positive numbers. It will be run every time the model is executed.

    ```sql linenums="1"
    MODEL (
        name sqlmesh_example.full_model,
        kind FULL,
        cron '@daily',
        grain item_id,
        audits [assert_positive_order_ids],
    );

    SELECT
        item_id,
        count(distinct id) AS num_orders,
    FROM
        sqlmesh_example.incremental_model
    GROUP BY item_id
    ```

![Run plan pane](./ui/ui-quickstart_run-plan.png)

Click the blue button labeled `Apply And Backfill` to apply the plan and initiate backfill. The `Backfill` section contents at the bottom will update.

The updated backfill output shows the operation's completion status. The first progress indicator shows the total number of tasks and completion percentage for the entire backfill operation. The remaining progress bars show completion percentage and run time for each model (very fast in this simple example).

![Apply plan pane](./ui/ui-quickstart_apply-plan.png)

Click the blue `Done` button to close the pane.

You've now created a new production environment with all of history backfilled.

### 2.2 Create a dev environment
Now that you've created a production environment, it's time to create a development environment so that you can modify models without affecting production.

Open the environment menu by clicking the button labeled `prod \/` next to the blue `Run plan` button on the top right. Type `dev` into the Environment field and click the blue `Add` button.

![Open environment menu](./ui/ui-quickstart_create-dev.png)

The button now shows that the SQLMesh UI is working in the `dev` environment:

![Working in dev environment](./ui/ui-quickstart_plan-dev.png)

Click the `Run Plan` button, and a new pane will open:

![Run plan on dev pane](./ui/ui-quickstart_run-plan-dev.png)

The pane title on the top left states that the plan's target environment is now `dev`. The error indicator on the top right shows that the plan has no errors associated with it.

The output does not list any added or modified models because `dev` is being created from the existing `prod` environment without modification.

Dates in the `Set Dates` section are automatically populated based on the `prod` environment.

The `Additional Options` section can be opened to display detailed configuration options for the plan.

Click the blue `Run` button to create the new plan:

![Run plan on dev pane output](./ui/ui-quickstart_run-plan-dev-output.png)

The `Backfill` section shows that only a virtual update will occur.

Click the blue `Apply Virtual Update` button to perform the virtual update:

![Apply virtual update on dev](./ui/ui-quickstart_apply-plan-dev.png)

The output confirms that the virtual update has completed. Click the blue `Done` button to close the pane.

## 3. Make your first update

Now that we have have populated both `prod` and `dev` environments, let's modify one of the SQL models, validate it in `dev`, and push it to `prod`.

### 3.1 Edit the configuration
To modify the incremental SQL model, open it in the editor by clicking on it in the project directory pane.

The inspector pane on the right now shows the `Actions` tab, where you can specify parameters and [`Evaluate`](../reference/cli.md#evaluate) the SQLMesh model. The `Docs` tab displays information about the model query, including its columns and the rendered query.

The `Details` pane at the bottom displays the project's table and column lineage.

![Incremental model open in editor](./ui/ui-quickstart_incremental-model.png)

Modify the incremental SQL model by adding a new column to the query. Press `Cmd + S` (`Ctrl + S` on Windows) to save the modified model file and display the updated lineage:

![Incremental model modified in editor](./ui/ui-quickstart_incremental-model-modified.png)


## 4. Plan and apply updates
Preview the impact of the change by clicking the `Run Plan` button in the top right.

Click the blue `Run` button in the newly opened pane, and the updated plan information will appear:

![Plan pane after running plan with modified incremental model](./ui/ui-quickstart_run-plan-dev-modified.png)

The `Test` output section notes that `plan` successfully executed the project's test `tests/test_full_model.yaml` with duckdb.

The `Models` section detects that we directly modified `incremental_model` and that `full_model` was indirectly modified because it selects from the incremental model. SQLMesh understood that the change was additive (added a column not used by `full_model`) and was automatically classified as a non-breaking change.

The `Backfill` section describes the models requiring backfill, including the incremental model from our start date `2020-01-01`. Click the blue `Apply And Backfill` button to apply the plan and execute the backfill:

![Plan after applying updated plan with modified incremental model](./ui/ui-quickstart_apply-plan-dev-modified.png)

SQLMesh applies the change to `sqlmesh_example.incremental_model` and backfills the model. The `Backfill` section shows that the backfill completed successfully.

### 4.1 Validate updates in dev
You can now view this change by querying data from `incremental_model`. Add the SQL query `select * from sqlmesh_example__dev.incremental_model` to the Custom SQL 1 tab in the editor:

![Querying `dev` incremental model with SQL query in editor](./ui/ui-quickstart_fetchdf-dev.png)

Note that the environment name `__dev` is appended to the schema namespace `sqlmesh_example` in the query: `select * from sqlmesh_example__dev.incremental_model`.

Click the `Run Query` button in the bottom right to execute the query:

![Results from querying dev incremental model with SQL query in editor](./ui/ui-quickstart_fetchdf-dev-results.png)

You can see that `new_column` was added to the dataset. The production table was not modified; you can validate this by modifying the query so it selects from the production table with `select * from sqlmesh_example.incremental_model`.

Note that nothing has been appended to the schema namespace `sqlmesh_example` because `prod` is the default environment.

![Results from querying `prod` incremental model with SQL query in editor](./ui/ui-quickstart_fetchdf-prod.png)

The production table does not have `new_column` because the changes to `dev` have not yet been applied to `prod`.

### 4.2 Apply updates to prod
Now that we've tested the changes in dev, it's time to move them to prod. Open the environment menu in top right and select the `prod` environment:

![`prod` environment selected in environment menu](./ui/ui-quickstart_plan-prod-modified.png)

Click the `Run Plan` button, and a warning screen will appear:

![`prod` environment modification warning](./ui/ui-quickstart_plan-prod-modified-warning.png)

Click the `Yes, Run prod` button to proceed, and the run plan interface will appear:

![`prod` environment plan pane](./ui/ui-quickstart_plan-prod-modified-pane.png)

Click the `Run` button, and the apply plan interface will appear:

![`prod` environment apply plan pane](./ui/ui-quickstart_apply-plan-prod-modified-pane.png)

Click the blue `Apply Virtual Update` button to apply the plan and execute the backfill:

![`prod` environment after applying plan](./ui/ui-quickstart_apply-plan-prod-modified.png)

Note that a backfill was not necessary and only a Virtual Update occurred. Click the blue `Done` button to close the pane.

### 4.3. Validate updates in prod
Double-check that the data updated in `prod` by re-running the SQL query from the editor. Click the `Run Query` button to execute the query:

![Results from querying updated `prod` incremental model with SQL query in editor](./ui/ui-quickstart_fetchdf-prod-modified.png)

`new_column` is now present in the `prod` incremental model.
