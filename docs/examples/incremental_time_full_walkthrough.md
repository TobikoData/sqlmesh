# Incremental by Time Range: Full Walkthrough

SQLMesh incremental models are a powerful feature that come in many flavors and configurations so you can fine tune your query performance and scheduled runs **exactly** how you want with a plethora of guardrails.

However, we recognize with all this power comes a responsibility to make sure you’re equipped to succeed confidently.

We’re going to walk you through a clear story problem step by step. The end outcome is for you to feel confident with this new workflow to:

- Build a mental model for how to solve data transformation problems with SQLMesh incremental models
- Know which configs to update and why
- Run a sequence of `sqlmesh` commands and know exactly what’s running and why
- Understand the tradeoffs between different approaches and make the right decisions for your use case
- Save precious time and money running your data transformation pipelines

## Story Problem

I am a data engineer working for a company selling software directly to customers. I have sales data with millions of transactions per day, and I want to add dimensions from other raw sources to better understand what sales/product trends are happening.

So I have two raw data sources like this:

- Source A: raw sales data is extracted and loaded into my data warehouse (think: BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, etc.) hourly
- Source B: product usage data from a backend database (think: Postgres) is extracted and loaded into my data warehouse daily

On first impression, this looks like a piece of cake. However, as I reflect on what success looks like for this to be built AND maintained well, there’s a lot of problems to solve for. Don’t worry, we answer all these questions at the end.

- How do I handle late-arriving data?
- How do I account for UTC vs. PST (California) timestamps, do I convert them?
- What schedule should I run these at?
- How do I test this data?
- How do I make this run fast and only the intervals necessary (read: partitions)?
- How do I make patch changes when an edge case error occurs with incorrect data from months ago?
- What do unit tests look and feel like for this?
- How do I prevent data gaps with unprocessed or incomplete intervals?
- Am I okay processing incomplete intervals (think: allow partials)?
- What tradeoffs am I willing to make for fresh data?
- How to make this not feel so complex during development?
- How do I know SQLMesh is behaving how I want it to behave?

## Development Workflow

You’ll be following this general sequence of actions when working with SQLMesh:

1. `sqlmesh plan dev`: create a dev environment for your new SQL model
2. `sqlmesh fetchdf`: preview data in dev
3. `sqlmesh create_external_models`: automatically generate documentation for raw source tables' column-level lineage
4. `sqlmesh plan`: promote model from dev to prod
5. `sqlmesh plan dev --forward-only`: make more code changes and only process new data going forward with those code changes; leave historical data alone
6. `sqlmesh fetchdf`: preview data in dev
7. `sqlmesh create_test`: automatically generate unit tests
8. `sqlmesh test`: run those unit tests
9. `sqlmesh plan`: promote dev to prod

> Note: If this is the first time you're running SQLMesh, I recommend following the [CLI Quickstart](../quickstart/cli.md) first and then coming back to this example.

## Setup

Let’s start with some demo data coupled with an existing SQLMesh project with models already in production.

I recommend not reading too much into the exact contents of this data outside of timestamps and primary/foreign keys. All of this is fabricated for the purposes of this guide.

We have data like the below that gets ingested into our data warehouse on a daily basis.

## Model Configuration

I can answer some of the questions above by walking through the model's config, coupled with the business logic/code I prepared ahead of time.

You can see this code in a SQLMesh project context [here](https://github.com/sungchun12/sqlmesh-demos/blob/incremental-demo/models/examples/incrementals_demo.sql).

```sql
MODEL (
  name demo.incrementals_demo,
  kind INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE (
    -- How does this model kind behave?
    --   DELETE by time range, then INSERT
    time_column transaction_date,

    -- How do I handle late-arriving data?
    --   Handle late-arriving events for the past 2 (2*1) days based on cron
    --   interval. Each time it runs, it will process today, yesterday, and
    --   the day before yesterday.
    lookback 2,
  ),

  -- Don't backfill data before this date
  start '2024-10-25',

  -- What schedule should I run these at?
  --   Daily at Midnight UTC
  cron '@daily',

  -- Good documentation for the primary key
  grain transaction_id,

  -- What tradeoffs am I willing to make for fresh data?
  --   I'm okay with allowing partial intervals to be processed for things
  --   like logging data, but for sales and product data I want to make sure
  --   complete intervals are processed so end users don't confuse incomplete
  --   data with incorrect data.
  allow_partials false, -- NOTE: false is default value

  -- How do I test this data?
  --   Validate that the `transaction_id` primary key values are both unique
  --   and non-null. Data audit tests only run for the processed intervals,
  --   not for the entire table.
  audits (
    UNIQUE_VALUES(columns = (transaction_id)),
    NOT_NULL(columns = (transaction_id))
  )
);

WITH sales_data AS (
  SELECT
    transaction_id,
    product_id,
    customer_id,
    transaction_amount,
    -- How do I account for UTC vs. PST (California baby) timestamps?
    --   Make sure all time columns are in UTC and convert them to PST in the
    --   presentation layer downstream.
    transaction_timestamp,
    payment_method,
    currency
  FROM sqlmesh-public-demo.tcloud_raw_data.sales  -- Source A: sales data
  -- How do I make this run fast and only process the necessary intervals?
  --   Use our date macros that will automatically run the necessary intervals.
  --   Because SQLMesh manages state, it will know what needs to run each time
  --   you invoke `sqlmesh run`.
  WHERE transaction_timestamp BETWEEN @start_dt AND @end_dt
),

product_usage AS (
  SELECT
    product_id,
    customer_id,
    last_usage_date,
    usage_count,
    feature_utilization_score,
    user_segment
  FROM sqlmesh-public-demo.tcloud_raw_data.product_usage  -- Source B
  -- Include usage data from the 30 days before the interval
  WHERE last_usage_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB(@start_dt, INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND @end_dt
)

SELECT
  s.transaction_id,
  s.product_id,
  s.customer_id,
  s.transaction_amount,
  -- Extract the date from the timestamp to partition by day
  DATE(s.transaction_timestamp) as transaction_date,
  -- Convert timestamp to PST using a SQL function in the presentation layer for end users
  DATETIME(s.transaction_timestamp, 'America/Los_Angeles') as transaction_timestamp_pst,

  p.feature_utilization_score,
  p.user_segment,
  -- Derived metrics
  CASE
    WHEN p.usage_count > 100 AND p.feature_utilization_score > 0.8 THEN 'Power User'
    WHEN p.usage_count > 50 THEN 'Regular User'
    WHEN p.usage_count IS NULL THEN 'New User'
    ELSE 'Light User'
  END as user_type,
  -- Time since last usage
  DATE_DIFF(s.transaction_timestamp, p.last_usage_date, DAY) as days_since_last_usage
FROM sales_data s
LEFT JOIN product_usage p
  ON s.product_id = p.product_id
  AND s.customer_id = p.customer_id
```

## Creating the model

I’m creating this model for the first time against an existing SQLMesh project that already has data in production. So let’s run this in a `dev` environment.

Run this command to add this incremental model to a `dev` environment:

```bash
sqlmesh plan dev
```

*Note: Using `sqlmesh` version `0.132.1` at the time of writing*

Keep pressing enter on the date prompts, as we want to backfill all of history since 2024-10-25.

```bash
(venv) ✗ sqlmesh plan dev
======================================================================
Successfully Ran 2 tests against duckdb
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of differences against `dev`:

Enter the backfill start date (eg. '1 year', '2020-01-01') or blank to backfill from the beginning of history:
Enter the backfill end date (eg. '1 month ago', '2020-01-01') or blank to backfill up until now:

Now I’m thinking to myself "what exact SQL queries are running to make sure this is behaving as I expect?"

This sequence of queries is exactly what’s happening in the query engine. Click on the toggles to see the SQL queries.

sqlmesh fetchdf "select * from demo__dev.incrementals_demo limit 5"

## Track Column Level Lineage

Now that I have a solid start to my development, I want to document and visualize how this transformation logic works without manually writing a bunch of `yaml` for the next hour.

Thankfully, I don’t have to. I’ll get an automatically generated `external_models.yaml` file that will parse my `incrementals_demo.sql` model and query BigQuery metadata to get all columns AND their data types. All of it neatly formatted.

Run this command:

```bash
sqlmesh create_external_models
```

```yaml
# external_models.yaml
- name: '`sqlmesh-public-demo`.`tcloud_raw_data`.`product_usage`'
  columns:
    product_id: STRING
    customer_id: STRING
    last_usage_date: TIMESTAMP
    usage_count: INT64
    feature_utilization_score: FLOAT64
    user_segment: STRING
- name: '`sqlmesh-public-demo`.`tcloud_raw_data`.`sales`'
  columns:
    transaction_id: STRING
    product_id: STRING
    customer_id: STRING
    transaction_amount: NUMERIC(10,2)
    transaction_timestamp: TIMESTAMP
    payment_method: STRING
    currency: STRING
```

Now, when I run the command below in my terminal and click on the link it will open up my browser to show the column level lineage I know and love.

```bash
sqlmesh ui
```

```bash
(venv) ✗ sqlmesh ui
INFO:     Started server process [89705]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.

```

When I click on a column in `demo.incrementals_demo`, it will trace the column to the source!

![image.png](../guides/ui/column_level_audit_trail.png)

Now, typically, I will promote these changes to production using SQLMesh’s open source GitHub CICD bot as shown in [this demo pull request](https://github.com/TobikoData/tobiko-cloud-demo/pull/4), but to keep this guide simpler, let’s run `sqlmesh plan` directly.

This is where I feel the claim “data transformation without the waste” feels tangible. I did all this great work in my dev environment, and I’m used to reprocessing and duplicating storage in production. However, by default SQLMesh will bypass all that and create new views to point to the same physical tables created in `dev`! You can see for yourself in the query history.

## Making Changes

Alright, it feels pretty neat to go through this workflow, but now comes the part that represents the majority of my job as a data engineer:

- Making changes
- Testing those changes
- Promoting those changes safely and confidently to production

Let’s say I want to change my code's definition of a power user but ONLY going forward because we want to broaden our definition. However, I still want to retain how we defined power users historically.

At first glance, this is a very surgical operation that can feel intimidating with custom `DML` operations, but thankfully SQLMesh has a native way to solve this problem.

First, I make the change to decrease the threshold in my SQL logic:

```sql
CASE
  WHEN p.usage_count > 50 AND p.feature_utilization_score > 0.5 THEN 'Power User'
```

Unlike last time, I run `sqlmesh plan dev --forward-only` with the `--forward-only` flag, which tells SQLMesh it should not run the changed model against all the existing data.

In the terminal output, I can see the change displayed like before, but I see some new date prompts.

I leave the [effective date](../concepts/plans.md#effective-date) prompt blank because I do not want to reprocess historical data in `prod` - I only want to apply this new business logic going forward.

However, I do want to preview the new business logic in my `dev` environment before pushing to `prod`. Because I have [configured SQLMesh to create previews](https://github.com/TobikoData/sqlmesh-demos/blob/e0e3899e173cf7b8447ae707402a9df59911d1c0/config.yaml#L42) for forward-only models in my `config.yaml` file, SQLMesh has created a temporary copy of the `prod` table in my `dev` environment, so I can test the new logic on historical data.

I specify the beginning of the preview's historical data window as `2024-10-27` in the preview start date prompt, and I specify the end of the window as now by leaving the preview end date prompt blank.

```bash
sqlmesh plan dev --forward-only
```

Now I’m getting exactly what I expect when I preview the data.

- Backfill (reprocess) the new definition of power user on and after 2024-10-27 in `dev` only
- See the new power user definition apply from 2024-10-27 to now
- Retain the old definition of power user before 2024-10-27 to preview the comparison

An experience I’d manually do outside of my transformation workflow with a cobbling of python scripts and ad hoc SQL is now both clear and predictable and tracked in SQLMesh’s state history.

Now, here, I may think through this question during development:

- What if I don’t like the data results during the preview part of my `sqlmesh plan dev --forward-only`?
    - I update my code changes, go through the above workflow again, and preview data for a specific date range whether for a regular `sqlmesh plan dev` or `sqlmesh plan dev --forward-only`

## Adding Unit Tests

Data audits are great, but they only verify basic things like primary key integrity. They don’t validate my SQL logic is doing exactly what I want.

I know SQLMesh has unit tests, but the quiet part out loud is that I dislike writing so much `yaml` by hand. Thankfully, I don’t have to.

I can use the `sqlmesh create_test` command to generate the unit test configuration file for me, using SQL queries to select and store the data the tests will run on.

```bash
sqlmesh create_test demo.incrementals_demo \
--query sqlmesh-public-demo.tcloud_raw_data.product_usage "select * from sqlmesh-public-demo.tcloud_raw_data.product_usage where customer_id='CUST-001'" \
--query sqlmesh-public-demo.tcloud_raw_data.sales "select * from sqlmesh-public-demo.tcloud_raw_data.sales where customer_id='CUST-001'" \
--var start_dt '2024-10-25' \
--var end_dt '2024-10-27'
```

It’ll create a unit test configuration file automatically like the below based on live queried data called `test_incrementals_demo.yaml`. I can then modify this file to my liking.

        end_dt: '2024-10-27'
    ```

Now, when I run `sqlmesh test` I run all my unit tests for free on my local machine.

SQLMesh runs these unit test fixtures directly in [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) in-memory by transpiling your specific database’s SQL syntax into the same meaning via [SQLGlot](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot). That’s why it runs so fast!

??? "I can also run my unit tests against my main query engine to test things like UDFs or if there’s very specific SQL functions that do not neatly transpile to duckdb. Example test connection."

## Promoting Changes to Production

Now that I’ve done all this great work, how do I get this promoted into production?

Typically, I will open a pull request combined with the [SQLMesh GitHub CI/CD bot](../integrations/github.md) as I mentioned earlier in this guide. But to keep it simple, I’ll run `sqlmesh plan` as I did above.

This time because it it’s promoting a forward-only dev model into prod, it’s a virtual update to the SQL definition.

We run a bunch of metadata queries to version tables. More queries (read: 15/15 in the progress bar) are run in this forward-only model promotion to track schema evolution, if it appears, between the old and new schema.

Next time it’s run, it’ll backfill new data with this new definition of ‘Power User’.

```bash
sqlmesh plan
```

```sql
(venv) ➜  sqlmesh-demos git:(incremental-demo) ✗ sqlmesh plan

## Summary

I went through a full workflow for an intimidating problem, and it feels really good knowing what goes on behind the scenes when I run these SQLMesh commands. For those coming from other transformation frameworks like dbt, this is a new way to work.

It respects data as infrastructure vs. things to rebuild many times over each time you change something. I hope you feel equipped AND confident to start using SQLMesh and especially incremental models today!

I’ll make it convenient for you in making sure we answered all the pertinent questions.

- How do I handle late arriving data?
    - Use the `lookback` config.
- How do I account for UTC vs. PST (California baby) timestamps, do I convert them?
    - See the SQL logic for how everything is in UTC by default for safe and reliable processing and then convert the presentation timestamp to PST for downstream tools (ex: business intelligence, data sharing)
- What schedule should I run these at?
    - Daily is a default as we don’t want to show incomplete intervals when merging product and sales information. You can go as low as 5 minutes.
- How do I test this data?
    - Unit tests for code, audits for data
- How do I make this run fast and only the intervals necessary (read: partitions)?
    - SQLMesh macros work by default to run and test only the intervals necessary because it manages state.
    - No `max(timestamp)` acrobatics.
- How do I make patch changes when an edge case error occurs with incorrect data for specific time ranges?
    - Make code changes and backfill only what’s necessary safely in dev before promoting to prod.
    - Retain history AND correct changes for specific time ranges.
    - Check out the forward-only example above and notice you can make **retroactive** changes to prod.
- What do unit tests look and feel like for this?
    - See automatic unit test creation above. No manual `yaml` handwriting!
- How do I prevent data gaps with unprocessed or incomplete intervals?
    - SQLMesh manages state, so it will track which intervals were backfilled vs. not.
    - Even if an interval failed during a scheduled `sqlmesh run`, it will recognize that the next time this command is run and attempt to backfill that previously failed interval.
    - No `max(timestamp)` acrobats.
- Am I okay processing incomplete intervals (think: allow partials)?
    - I'm only okay with allowing partial intervals to be processed for things like logging event data, but for sales and product data, I want to make sure complete intervals are processed so end users don't confuse incomplete data with incorrect data.
- What tradeoffs am I willing to make for fresh data?
    - I prefer complete data over fresh data for its own sake. Correctness matters when viewing revenue data.
- How to make this not feel so complex during development?
    - Hopefully this guide helps ;)
- How do I know SQLMesh is behaving how I want it to behave?
    - See the queries run by SQLMesh above. They’re listed out exactly as listed in the query history.
    - I skip listing out basic metadata queries and test connection queries like `SELECT 1` as those are more background tasks than core logic tasks.
- Bonus question: How does this compare to dbt’s way of handling incrementals?
    - [See here for a complete comparison](https://tobikodata.com/dbt-incremental-but-incomplete.html)
